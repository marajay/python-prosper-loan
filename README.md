# python-prosper-loan

Introduction:
The Prosper Loan dataset provides a wealth of information regarding loans facilitated through the Prosper platform. The dataset includes attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, loan status, credit score, and many other variables. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into loan performance and borrower behavior.

DATA EXPLORATION
we will conduct an exploratory data analysis on the dataset. We will use Python and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part is structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

Data Quality Check:
Before conducting the analysis, we performed a thorough data quality check to ensure data integrity and consistency. This process involved identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the dataset.
